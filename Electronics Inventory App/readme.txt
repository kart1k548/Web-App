Electronics Inventory Web App:

1) I developed this Electronics Inventory Web Application using HTML, Nodejs, CSS, PostgreSQL and Bootstrap.

2) This application has three user categories(viewer, administrator, seller).

Viewer- this category of user can only see the data in inventory
Admin- this category of user has full rights over the info
Seller- this category of user can view, edit and delete the data in inventory

3) This application allows us to maintain a record of registered users and items in the inventory.

Steps to run this web app:

Step 1: Open command prompt and navigate to web app's present folder.

Step 2: Type command "node server.js" in order to start the server.

Step 3: Open your web browser and navigate to this link: "http://127.0.0.1:5002"
